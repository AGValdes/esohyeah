                <p class="wetext">The Bosmer, also known as Wood Elves, call Valenwood their home. Their short stature makes them great thieves and archers. A pact the Bosmer follow, called the Green Pact, makes the race complete carnivores. Because they call the trees home, the Bosmer are not allowed to harm any plant for their gain.

                <p class="hetext">The Altmer, called the High Elves, call Summerset Isle their home. They are much taller than the other races and they have golden skin. Their proficiency with magic is greater than all the other races. Because of this it also makes them the most susceptible to magic attacks. Altmer is translated to “High Folk” and their name is derived from their ancestors, the Aldmer.

                <p class="ktext">Khajiit are cat-like people who come from Elsweyr, known for high intelligence and agility. These traits make them very good thieves and acrobats, but Khajiit are also fearsome warriors. Khajiit, Argonians, and Imga are the so-called "beast races" of Tamriel because of these large differences.
